**How do I approach designing software?**
Start with understanding the problem, then plan the architecture, user interface, and data structures. Choose the right technologies, write clean code, test thoroughly, and iterate based on feedback.

**What new design skills has your work on the project helped you to craft?**
This depends on the specific project. It could include skills like UI/UX design, database design, algorithm design, or system architecture.

**What design process did you follow for your project work?**
Common processes include Agile, Waterfall, or a more iterative, prototype-driven approach. The key is to plan, design, implement, test, and refine.

**How could tactics from your design approach be applied in future work?**
This might involve reusing design patterns, applying lessons learned about user feedback, or adapting the development process for different project requirements.

**How do I approach developing programs?**
Start with a clear understanding of the requirements, break the problem into smaller parts, write clean and well-documented code, test frequently, and use version control.

**What new development strategies did you use while working on your 3D scene?**
This could include learning new APIs, optimization techniques, or working with specific 3D modeling or rendering tools.

***How did iteration factor into your development?**
Iteration involves repeatedly refining the design and implementation based on testing and feedback. This helps improve the quality and usability of the software.

**How has your approach to developing code evolved throughout the milestones, which led you to the projectâ€™s completion?**
This might involve learning to write more modular code, improving testing strategies, or becoming more efficient at debugging.

**How can computer science help me in reaching my goals?**
Computer science provides tools and techniques for solving problems, automating tasks, and creating new technologies. It can help you in fields like data analysis, software development, and research.

**How do computational graphics and visualizations give you new knowledge and skills that can be applied in your future educational pathway?**
They can help you understand complex data, develop problem-solving skills, and create engaging presentations.

**How do computational graphics and visualizations give you new knowledge and skills that can be applied in your future professional pathway?** 
These skills are valuable in fields like design, marketing, scientific research, and data analysis, allowing you to communicate complex information effectively.
